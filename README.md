Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 7: Design an A/B Test

In this project, I am considering an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. I am fleshing the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyzing the results, and proposing a high-level follow-on experiment
