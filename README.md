Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 7: Design an A/B Test

Designed an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. I also analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity, recommended a decision, and proposed a follow-up experiment.

In this project, I am considering an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. I am fleshing the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyzing the results, and proposing a high-level follow-on experiment
